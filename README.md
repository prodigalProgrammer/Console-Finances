# Console-Finances

## Description

In this project I was given a dataset composed of arrays which has two fields: Date and Profit/Losses. My task was to write JavaScript code that analyses the records to calculate:

- The total number of months in the dataset.
- The NET total amount of Profits/Losses over the whole period.
- The average of the movements in Profit/Losses over the whole period.
- Largest increase in Profits over any given month.
- Largest decrease in Losses over any given month.

## Usage

The results are calculated and displayed in the Console as soon as the webpage is opened. None of the results are hardcoded and are displayed from variables. Some of the calculations vary in complexity, and there are many ways to get the same results but I used techniques I was familiar with like:

- String Template Literals: `${ }`.
- The For-Of Loop.
- Both `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` methods.
- The Spread Operator: `(...ArrayName)`.
- Destructuring (`for (const [index-1, index-2] of Array)`).
- The `reduce()` method.
