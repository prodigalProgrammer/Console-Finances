# Console-Finances

## Description

In this project I was given a dataset composed of arrays which has two fields: Date and Profit/Losses. My task was to write JavaScript code that analyses the records to calculate:

- The total number of months in the dataset.
- The NET total amount of Profits/Losses over the whole period.
- The average of the movements in Profit/Losses over the whole period.
- Largest increase in Profits over any given month.
- Largest decrease in Losses over any given month.
